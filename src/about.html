                    Mirror is a site where you can remotely access your SQL-based<br/>
                    databases. Mirror gives you the power to use SQL querys to view, edit <br/>
                    and manage your databases anywhere.<br/><br/>
                    To get started, enter in your database's details.<br/>
                    Once a connection is established, you can type SQL into the command<br/> 
                    box and click run to submit. The response to this will be displayed<br/>below.

                    To get this out the way, this site can't access any of your database credentials.<br/>
                    This being said, MAKE SURE YOUR CONNECTION TO THIS SITE IS SECURE before connecting.<br/>
                    Credentials are posted to our server, if an attacker intercepts this and https <br/>isn't being used,
                    it is possible that they could then access this data unencrypted, so be carefull!
